## STATEMENT OF WORK
after wasting precious time on researching overly ambitious project scopes, i've settled on a simple wifi-network scanner. To satisfy the code portion of the project, I plan to have the scanner create a dictionary of visible networks, with a flag if there are any new networks from the last time it checked.
